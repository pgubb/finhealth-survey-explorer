,Resilience. (Ultimate goal stated in the National Financial Literacy Strategy),,,,,,,
,1. Comments/observations on target outcome,,A focused approach to resilience asks only about ability to weather financial setbacks or shocks. A broader approach considers resilience as synonymous with being in a generally healthy financial condition. Both types of questions are shown here.  ,,,,,
,2. Assessment of coverage of target outcome internationally,,üòê,"Observations: Two classic types of question are often used to guage ability to weather shocks: a) ability to raise a lump sum to meet an emergency and b) length of time consumption can be maintained in the face of income loss. Variations include size of lump sum, sources for obtaining the money, time frames, and levels of income loss. Financial health or well-being is typically measured through a module of 5-10 questions that cover short term financial status, ability to withstand shocks, ability to reach long term goals and confidence in one's finances.",,,,
,3. Best examples,,1,"If you lost your main source of household income, how long could your household continue to cover living expenses, without having to borrow any money or ask for help from friends or family?  Less than a week; between one week and a month; 1-3 months; 3-6 months; 6 months or longer; Don‚Äôt know; Refused",,,,
,,,2,"Suppose that you have an emergency expense that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense?
Put it on my credit card and pay it off in full at the next statement
