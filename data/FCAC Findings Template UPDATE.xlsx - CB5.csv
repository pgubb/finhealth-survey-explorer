,1. Comments/observations on target outcome,,"This is the only place resilience, i.e.  ability to weather shocks, is directly highlighted in the TOs and CBBs. Given that resilience is the national strategy's overall goal, we have placed most questions on resilience on a separate worksheet. Here we only include questions that directly mention savings.  ",,,,,
,2. Assessment of coverage of target outcome internationally,,üòê,"Observations: Savings practices are relatively well-queried. Questions cover attitudes, habits, and actions. Questions about attitudes can yield insights, but need support from habit and action questions to yield outcome measures. Although investments are closely related, only a few questions ask about investments, possilby because investing is seen as a) for high income segments and/or b) related to a separate part of the financial system (different institutions, different regulators) and therefore is not explored in general financial capability surveys.
