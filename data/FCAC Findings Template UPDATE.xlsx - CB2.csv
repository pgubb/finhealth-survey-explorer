,CB2,"Just-in-time knowledge and confidence. The aim of this building block is to enable more Canadians to have the information they need at the right time, along with the understanding, skills and confidence to use that information to achieve their financial goals.",,,,,,,,
,,1. Comments/observations on target outcome,,"The emphasis of this CBB per the stratey is on the timing of information delivery near or at the point of a decision: ""Learning about a financial product or service at the right time can help people make better decisions. For example, it is best to help consumers learn about different types of mortgages, interest rates, terms, amortization, and prepayment penalties when they are considering buying a house. Similarly, it is useful to help consumers understand interest rates, compound interest and repayment times for credit card balances when they are choosing between different credit cards (such as between a high-interest rewards card or a low-interest no-rewards card). Research shows that consumers are most likely to be receptive to information when it is relevant to them, that is, just-in-time, and at the point of decision. Research also shows that just-in-time is when information is most likely to drive decisions that lead to good outcomes."" This building block overlaps with CB1 andd TO2.1",,,,,,
,,2. Assessment of coverage of target outcome internationally,,üòê,"Observations: 
The questions we identified were either aimed at examining the use of informaiton at the time of product purchase or the tracking of personal financial information in managing budgets and planning.",,,,,
,,3. Best examples,,1,"When you took out this loan, which of the following best describes how you read the credit agreement and pre-contract information? Read it all carefully, just read the important bits, looked at it briefly, didn't read any; didn't get info",,,,,
,,,,2,"In selecting your [product], which of these did you do before making a decision? Compare products from different providers; compare various products from one provider; did not consider other options; searched other providers but they had no options to consider",,,,,
,,,,3,"When your household receives/ you receive your regular income, how often do you plan how it will be used?
1. Very often/always; 2. Often; 3. Sometimes; 4. Seldom/not very often; 5. Never; 6. DK",,,,,
,,4. Recommendations/ Proposed Indicators,,"The most relevant questions dig into the decisionmaking process, by product -- product information provided and used, confidence in the decision, and satisfaction with the outcome. A possible second line of inquiry could involve the use of a person's own financial information for decisions, for example, a question on the use of tool that categorizes spending. ",,,,,,
