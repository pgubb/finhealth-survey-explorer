CB4,Managing debt. The aim of this building block is to enable more Canadians to feel in control of their overall debt situation.,,,,,,,
,1. Comments/observations on target outcome,,"This CBB is phrased in a way that emphasizes the subjective aspect of debt burden, that is, whether a person can manage their debts without undue stress. To measure this, a combination of objective questions focused on the level of indebtedness would be combined with questions on the perceived burden arising from debt. Questions on incidence of debt payment interruptions would be especially useful.",,,,,
,2. Assessment of coverage of target outcome internationally,,üòê,Observations: Questions found are very similar across surveys. Most focus on the perception and consequences of debt stress. Some ask about borrowing practices. Few questions query actual levels of debt.,,,,
,3. Best examples,,1,"Thinking about all of your household‚Äôs current debts... As of today, which of the following statements describes how manageable your household debt is?
Have a manageable amount of debt; 
Have a bit more debt than is manageable; 
Have far more debt than is manageable; 
Do not have any debt",,,,
,,,2,"How often does your household/ you use a credit card, overdraft or borrow money to buy food or to pay expenses because you have run short of money? 1 Very often; 2 Often; 3 Now and then; 4 Seldom; 5 Never; 6 Don't know",,,,
,,,3,"How much stress does the total debt you (and your spouse/partner) are carrying cause to you?
A great deal of stress; Quite a bit; Some stress; Not very much; No stress at all",,,,
,,,4,"How much of a problem, if any, has your debt caused for your family life? Job performance? Health?
An extreme problem; A large problem; A medium problem; No problem at all",,,,
,,,5,"How would you rate your credit score? Your credit score is a number that tells lenders how risky or safe you are as a borrower.
Excellent; Very good; Good; Fair; Poor; Don't know",,,,
,4. Recommendations/ Proposed Indicators,,"Asking the 5 questions shown here (actually 7, because 4th question is a compound) would provide enough evidence to place individuals on a spectrum from positive debt managment to extreme debt stress. Objective data such as trends in a person's credit score and their ratio of debt service to income, would also be important.",,,,,
